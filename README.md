# team4
Team 4's project for the SSED PAIS Hackathon.

This is a short POC for the concept documented at [ezpx.github.io](https://ezpx.github.io/) for iOS, using Apple's [MultipeerConnectivity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/multipeerconnectivity/) framework to do peer-to-peer networking over the *Apple Wireless Direct Link* protocol. Because it uses AWDL, it does not require peers to be connected to an access point.

No security is implemented in the POC, tho the framework supports encryption using X.509 certificates.
